Stores notebooks used for training NN-architectures used in deepNOG-prediction-tool.

### singletask-cnn

Convolutional network (similar to DeepFam) trained on eggNOG5 classes on bacterial level. Architecture conceived by Roman for multiclass-classification on eggNOG5 and pfam classes, adapted by Lukas to focus on single-task classification of eggNOG5 labels. Adaption due to increasing training data using only eggNOG5 as well as comparability with DeepFam architecture.
