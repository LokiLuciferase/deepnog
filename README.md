This repository is roughly devided in two parts:
* Deep learning based project to develop and train neural networks for orthologous group predictions in eggNOG 5.0 and protein family predictions on Pfam. 
* Deep learning based tool, built upon the previous project, to predict, if a protein sequence can be assigned to an orthologous group in eggNOG 5.0 or Pfam.
