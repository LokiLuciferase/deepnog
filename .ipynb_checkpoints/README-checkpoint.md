This repository is roughly devided in two parts:
* Deep learning based project to develop and train neural networks for orthologous group predictions in eggNOG 5.0 (and possibly other databases). 
* Deep learning based tool, built upon the previous project, to predict for a given protein sequence its corresponding most likely orthologous group in eggNOG 5.0.
